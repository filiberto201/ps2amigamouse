# ps2amigamouse

This is a simple sketch that allows you to connect your PS/2 mouse to your Commodore Amiga 500. Other Amiga types may work, but are untested. I wrote this quite some time ago but never gotten around to share it. 

It uses a slighly modified PS2Mouse.cpp but I'm not sure where I got the original from and what has been modified.


The code is far from pretty... 

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Theoretically a middle button could be supported, but this only supported the LEFT and the RIGHT buttons.
- Mouse speed is hardcoded.
